## Project Proposals
For this database model, the team was required to propose several predictions. Listed are the ideas expressed before the selection of The STEM Salary Potential Prediction.

** HSV Mental Health Prediction **
The Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a commonly sexually transmitted infection with significant medical and psychological implications. The psychological impact of an HSV diagnosis can be substantial, many times leading to being faced against stigma, anxiety, depression, and an overall decline in mental health. 

Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends against regular testing for HSV. The rationale behind this recommendation is that knowing one's status, especially if tested positive, may lead to a decline in mental health with sexual activity remaining the same. This presents a unique challenge in public health, this recommendation places psychological well-being above the importance of disease prevention and control. 

The objective of the project is to develop a predictive model to assess other risk factors that could be contributing to the decline in mental health of people with a positive HSV diagnosis. The model will view socioeconomic and demographic factors such as income rates, education rates, age, and race in the areas where lower mental health was collected in datasets. The factors proposed are typical stress aspects of life that may have been a previous oversight in past conclusions. A machine learning model that evaluates mental health metrics with a high focus on other risk profiles will either predict a correlation to a recent HSV diagnosis or reveal a potential causation due to these factors.

** STEM Salary Potential Prediction **
The project's objective is to develop a predictive model that assesses whether attending a particular school results in a higher salary, considering the influence of STEM education at each school. School choice is a critical decision in an individual's educational journey considering the cost of attendance at highly notable schools. Analyzing and predicting the outcomes of school choice and STEM education can provide valuable insight into whether or not specific schools can result in higher salaries. With the growing rate of large companies hiring from a diverse range of schools such as Georgia State University rather than only Ivy League, this project can be extremely beneficial. The primary focus points include building a predictive model that evaluates the impact of school choice on salary potential, providing a tool for prospective students to assess the potential return on investment based on the tuition costs, analyzing the relationship between STEM program enrollment and salaries of graduates, and recommending affordable schools that tend to have great resulting salaries and high scholarships amounts. The datasets that will be utilized have incredible information such as STEM percentage, demographics, salary upon graduation and years later, states of schools, tuition increase over years, etc. This will allow for a wide range of features to build the predictive model that was directly tested on one focus group over three years.

** Credit Approval Prediction **
  In the United States, one of the most important factors in financial well-being is a credit rating. A high rating allows people to get approved for loans of higher amounts and with lower interest rates than people who have a lower credit score. One way to increase this score is by getting a new credit card. While there is no way to know for certain if someone is likely to be approved for a new credit card just by knowing their credit score, we can make a prediction based on previous data.
  Factors that go into credit approval include credit history length, card utilization rates, on-time payment history, and more. Other factors can go into the approval process, which are more personal, such as gender, income, and having kids. All of these included, banks go through their approval processes to determine whether or not to give someone a new card or loan. By tracking this data and seeing the relation between each of these factors and the history of credit approvals, we can predict someoneâ€™s approval odds before they apply to prevent them from damaging their credit by getting denied.
