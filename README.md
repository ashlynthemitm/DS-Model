## Project Proposal

The Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a commonly sexually transmitted infection with significant medical and psychological implications. The psychological impact of an HSV diagnosis can be substantial, many times leading to being faced against stigma, anxiety, depression, and an overall decline in mental health. 

Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends against regular testing for HSV. The rationale behind this recommendation is that knowing one's status, especially if tested positive, may lead to a decline in mental health with sexual activity remaining the same. This presents a unique challenge in public health, this recommendation places psychological well-being above the importance of disease prevention and control. 

The objective of the project is to develop a predictive model to assess the factors that could be the actual outcomes of people with a positive HSV diagnosis. The model will view a combination of socioeconomic and demographic factors such as income and education rates, age, and race in the areas in which lower mental health was collected in datasets. The factors proposed are typical stress aspects of life that may have been a previous oversight in previous conclusions. A machine learning model that evaluates mental health metrics with a high focus on other risk profiles will either predict a correlation to a recent HSV diagnosis or reveal a potential causation due to these factors.
